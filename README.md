# TimeCapsule
collaborative project: website as a time capsule

In the beginning of an era of hyperconnectivity,
through platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat,
and more, we began to talk more. Introduced was the
concept of Call-Out Culture or Cancel Culture.
We began holding our peers more accountable and paid
closer attention to eachother. Good? Bad? Weâ€™re not
sure, but we believe you may have a better idea
ten years from now. Enjoy, and thank you
for your participation and consideration.

Our group began by considering the platforms of web.
What is thought to be temporary, what isn't
what could we encapsulate that you normally
wouldn't? This led to the discussion of
call - out culture and cancel culture. The modern
brash response to the resurfacing of past materials.
We could find value in holding eachother more
accountable but also found flaws in the rapid
nature, and discount of legal values alike
being innocent before proven guilty. We discovered
this was a modern conversation, one that could
best be revisited in 10 years. Thus, our time capsule.
