    <h1><br>About</h1>
    <div class = "about"><br>In the beginning of an era, an era of hyperconnectivity
      <br>through platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat,
      <br>and more, we began to talk more. Introduced was the
      <br>concept of Call-Out Culture or Cancel Culture.
      <br>We began holding our peers more accountable and paid
      <br>closer attention to eachother. Good? Bad? Weâ€™re not
      <br>sure, but we believe you may have a better idea
      <br>ten years from now. Enjoy, and thank you
      <br>for your participation and consideration.

    <!-- <div class="opening">The Purpose of this time capsule is to give a collection on important events that revoled around the call-out/outrage/cancel culture that appeared throughout 2015-2019 for viewers, thats you 2029 guys, to read, think, and form your own opinions of these events. Call out culture as defined by wikipeadia is "is the social phenomenon of publicly denouncing perceived racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, national interest, and other forms of bigotry. Denunciation   can happen in person or online." It is important to note that the vast majority of people during this time have access to internet and therefore even things said in person usually end up online.</div>
