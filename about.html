    <h1><br>ABOUT</h1>
    <div class = "about"><br>In the beginning of an era hyperconnectivity,
      <br>through platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat,
      <br>and more, we began to talk more. Introduced was the
      <br>concept of <em>Call-Out Culture</em> or <em>Cancel Culture</em>.
      <br>We began holding our peers more accountable and paid
      <br>closer attention to eachother. Good? Bad? Weâ€™re not
      <br>sure, but we believe you may have a better idea
      <br>ten years from now. Enjoy, and thank you
      <br>for your participation and consideration.
